2) File Manager → public_html (or your site root).
3) Upload everything inside this folder (keep the same structure).
4) Ensure index.html is in the root (public_html) so it loads as the homepage.
5) Visit CoreAdvisors.ca to confirm.

Notes:
- Contact form uses "mailto:" so it works on static hosting with no server.
- To add a real booking calendar later: embed Calendly in contact.html where the "Tip" box is.
- To change email: search "hello@coreadvisors.ca" in contact.html and footer.
